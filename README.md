### Grass - *Just another matcha cafe incorporating ceremonial-grade matcha powder into tasty items.*

I created a website for a fictional matcha cafe in NYC, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features include:
- A page with clickable "tab modules" (home, menu, contact)
- A footer with links to social media (Instagram and TikTok)

Main things that I learnt/implemented while building the website:
- Setting up npm, webpack, JSON files
- Updating the page contents by modifying the DOM using JS, rather than hardcoding in HTML
- JS modules
